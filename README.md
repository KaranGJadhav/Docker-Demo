# Docker-Demo 
Example explains use of Docker,WSGI,Docker Images,Flask,Flasgger frameworks to expose ML model as an API.

I have used a simple Iris dataset to demonstrate the end to end process of machine learnining using Random Forest Algorithm.Python module called pickle is used for serialization and Deserialization of the ML model. Flasgger framework is used for UI generation. Flask framework is used to expose ML model as an API.
This example also illustrates the use of Docker,Docker Images and WSGI which acts as a middleware between the server and the Flask application.
This model illustrates the following.
1. Extrating data from the datasource.
2. Loading the dataset into our model.
3. Feature Engineering.
4. Feature Selection.
5. Data Modeling.
6. Deployment.
7. Testing.
